        <h2>United States Green Building Council / LEED Certification</h2>
        <p>
            NBA Engineering, Inc. was one of the first MEP design firms to have LEED Accredited Professionals on staff and NBA joined the 
            United States Green Building Council in its infancy. NBA remains an early adapter of green technology working with vendors, 
            clients, engineering peers to promote, advance, and advocate for increasing energy efficiency, water conservation, solar technology, 
            and other sustainable environmentally sound solutions for buildings, schools, and other projects.
        </p>
        <h2>NBA was part of original team for initial Green project</h2>
        <p>
            NBA took part in the demonstration project that started the LEED trend working on the Lakeview Terrace Branch Library in Los Angeles, 
            California. The 10,700 sq. ft. Lakeview Library was completed in 2003. Green features included photovoltaic cells providing 15 
            percent of the electricity need. High efficiency irrigation systems reduce site water usage by 50 percent; high efficiency interior 
            fixtures reduce water use by 30 percent. 
        </p>
        <h2>NBA advocates, educates, and promotes Green Design</h2>
        <p>
            NBA has been a part of numerous award-winning projects (as prime consultant) including Oakland’s Terminal 2 which recently 
            became &quot;the first airport passenger terminal in the United States to be awarded Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) 
            Silver Certification by the U.S. Green Building Council,&quot; UCSF Mission Bay Campus Community Center, BART to SFO, the San Francisco 
            Old Mint and many others. Several public schools, the Alameda Juvenile Justice Center as well as other projects with LEED equivalent 
            sustainable features. We encourage every client, owner, and project team to incorporate as many green 
            building - energy conservation – environmentally sensible features as possible. We are also currently working on LEED rated 
            condominiums, green public power in San Francisco and other exciting state of the art green design.
        </p>
        <h2>Historical Landmark gets cutting edge technology Greening the Old Mint</h2>
        <p>
            The San Francisco Old Mint will be the oldest historical building in the United States with a LEED certification. 
            It is exciting to incorporate the latest sustainable design features while at the same time respecting the historical integrity 
            of the building and maintaining its Landmark building status.
        </p>
        <h2>NBA Environmental Conservation Policy</h2>
        <p>
            NBA has a written environmental policy goal to create an environment-conscious workplace. 
            This includes waste reduction, reuse and recycling, energy and resource conservation, etc. All NBA offices recycle 
            paper, cans, and other goods; office lighting is the latest energy efficient type. Every small action helps.
        </p>
        <h2>Unlimited Potential for Sustainable Buildings</h2>
        <p>
            In the beginning the higher upfront costs of sustainable design prevented some owners from going green. 
            Today upfront costs with incentives and planning are no longer impeding green features. In fact the market place is 
            demanding green offices, green housing, and green schools. Having only one earth with limited natural resources is 
            enough incentive to go green. That and the engine of economic benefits for builders/owners/end users will drive exciting 
            new sustainable and environmentally sound buildings and systems for the future.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="tabGreenIncentives" class="tab">
        <h2>Schools and Green Design</h2>
        <p>
            The best investment a society can make is to provide clean, safe, healthy schools to enhance the learning environment for students 
            and teachers. Education is vital to our future. Research studies show that green and sustainable design has an overwhelming 
            impact on the health and productivity of students. Day lighting and indoor air quality are key components. There are numerous 
            studies from well respected researchers demonstrating the incredible benefits of green design.
        </p>
        <h2>Green Design is not just for schools</h2>
        <p>
            Green schools use, on average, 30-50% less energy. Green schools use, on average, 30% less water. Studies show an average of 38.5% 
            reduction in asthma in schools with improved indoor air quality.

            Students in full-spectrum light were healthier, attending school 3.2 to 3.8 days more per year. Students in full-spectrum 
            light had 9 times less dental decay than students attending schools with average light.

            Study of over 21,000 students showed a dramatic correlation between day lit school environments and student performance including
            20% faster progression in math and 26% faster progression in reading.
        </p>
        <h2>Healthier and More Productive Buildings for less money</h2>
        <p>
            According to studies by the American Lung Association one third of all buildings have serious indoor air quality problems.

            According to a study by the USGBC poor indoor air quality in U.S. causes annual loss of $15 billion in worker productivity.

            U.S. residential duct leakage costs consumers $5 billion annually while proper duct sealing can reduce home heating and air-conditioning 
            costs a great deal.
        </p>
        <h2>From California</h2>
        <p>
            The State of California Solar or Wind Energy System Credit and the Emerging Renewable Programs are two of many tax incentives and 
            rebates the State has to offer.

            Section 73 of the California Revenue and Taxation Code allows a property tax exemption for certain types of solar energy systems 
            installed on or before December 31, 2009.
        </p>
        <h2>Other Agency Incentives</h2>
        <p>
            Alameda P&T offers $25,000 for energy efficient building design and equipment in new commercial construction.

            A design team can receive up to $50,000 for energy efficient design, while an owner can receive up to $150,000 per facility with 
            the New Construction Cash Incentives and Design Incentives Program.

            Falcon Waterfree Technologies is piloting a new program open to school districts that will save 40,000 gallons of water per year 
            for every flush urinal replaced.
