                <h3>San Francisco Old Mint, San Francisco, California</h3>
                <p>
                    The 100,000 sq. ft. Classical Revival styled Mint was built in 1874 for two million dollars. The $89.7 million renovation and adaptive reuse project now underway will transform the Mint Into the first U.S. history museum to be built in the 21st Century. The Mint will be one of the first LEED-Certified (probably Silver) National Landmarks in the United States. NBA is providing complete MEP design services. We are working with other consultants to avoid damage to or visual impact on the historic building elements while incorporating the latest green design technology for the LEED rating.
