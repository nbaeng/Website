                <h4>Project Description</h4>
                <p>
                    The Hunters Point Naval Shipyard was established in 1869 in southeastern San Francisco as the first dry 
                    dock on the Pacific Coast. In 1940, the Navy obtained ownership of the shipyard for shipbuilding, repair 
                    and maintenance activities and subsequently to submarine services and testing. The shipyard consists of 
                    936 acres: 493 on land and 443 under water in San Francisco Bay. In 1991 clean up commenced in preparation 
                    for civilian re-use. In 1999 Lennar BV Partners was selected to develop the 550 acres of land that had been 
                    divided into 6 parcels.
