                <p>
                    Based out of the Oakland Office of F.E. Jordan Associates, Inc., the planning team of Summit/Lynch Consulting Engineers, 
                    Frederic R. Harris, Inc. and F.E. Jordan Associates, Inc. was retained by the Port of Oakland to perform an operational 
                    Analysis and develop an Operating Plan for the new Joint Intermodal Terminal (JIT). The JIT was planned to provide an 
                    intermodal terminal in the Port area for Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Company (BNSF) and to decrease the 
                    necessity to transport containers between the Port and the BNSF terminal in Richmond, California, 12 miles away.

                    The completed terminal provides greater rail access for shippers and increased container capacity, accommodating 250,000 
                    containers per year. 

                    The new 85-acre facility, operated by BNSF, features 13,300 feet of loading and unloading track that can 
                    accommodate 410 – 40 foot containers at any time.
