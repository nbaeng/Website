                <h4>Project Description</h4>
                <p>
                    The Stone & Webster/F.E. Jordan Associates Joint Venture was retained by the City and County of San Francisco 
                    for architectural/engineering, design and construction support services for the $56 million North Field Cargo 
                    Facilities at San Francisco International Airport.

                    The primary features of the building are a 170,000 sq. ft. first level material handling and storage area and a 
                    50,000 sq. ft. second level with administrative offices. This multi-user facility is a high bay structure that 
                    includes a Lodige storage system. The facility tenants are FedEx, Nippon and Korean Airlines.

                    A 200,000 sq. ft. PCC apron, AC taxiway and truck loading dock are included as site work. Six aircraft gates with 
                    hard stands for maintenance, off hauling of cargo and fueling of aircraft are incorporated. A major SFIA utility 
                    trench has been relocated along the perimeter of the site. The trench includes utilities serving the entire airport. 
                    The cost of the apron and site improvements is $23,000,000.
                </p>
                <h4>Firm’s Role</h4>
                <p>
                    The firm provided project management, cost estimating and scheduling, as well as architectural and engineering services 
                    for programming and final design. Construction support for the North Field Cargo Facilities project was also provided 
                    by FEJA including the construction management.

                    Another phase of the project included design of a stormwater detention facility and a pumping station to drain it. 
                    This phase also included design of another pump station to pump storm water directly into the San Francisco Bay 
                    after the &quot;first flush&quot; was in the detention facility.
