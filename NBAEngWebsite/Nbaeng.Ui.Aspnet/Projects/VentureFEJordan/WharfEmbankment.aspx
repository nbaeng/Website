                <h4>Description</h4>
                <p>
                    The Port of Oakland has embarked on a Wharf Embankment Strengthening Program (WESP) to retrofit its existing wharf facilities. 
                    The program encompasses deepening the existing waterside wharves to an elevation of –55&rsquo;-0&rdquo;.
                </p>

                <h4>Firm’s Role</h4>
                <p>
                F.E. Jordan Associates, Inc. was selected by the Port to review and evaluate Berths 26 (Transbay), 30 (Trapac Container Terminal), 
                Berth 67-68 (Howard Terminal) and the extension of Berths 67-68 (Howard Terminal Expansion). The program was divided into two phases. 

                Phase 1 involved performing seismic analysis of the existing structure based upon three levels of seismic performance as defined by the 
                Port.

                Phase 2 consisted of performing a seismic risk reduction analysis for the deepened wharf. Also there were design upgrades for the 
                crane and berth facilities for the future generation of cargo vessels that the Port expects to be utilizing the facilities over 
                the next fifty years. This phase included producing schematic and construction documents required to accommodate the upgrades and 
                construction administration during construction.
