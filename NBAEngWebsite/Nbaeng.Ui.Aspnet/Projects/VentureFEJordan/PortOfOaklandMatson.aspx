                <p>
                    F.E. Jordan Associates, Inc. provided engineering services to the Port of Oakland to effect design and other 
                    engineering support services in connection with permanent repair to the Matson Terminal Wharf, Berths 32 and 33, 
                    in the area of the Seventh Street Complex. Some damage was experienced in piles and their connections during the 
                    October 17, 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. The project provided permanent resistance to seismic effects and facilitated 
                    other modifications.
