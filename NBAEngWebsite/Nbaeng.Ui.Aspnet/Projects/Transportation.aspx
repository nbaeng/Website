                <h3>T2 Mechanical Room Oakland International Airport Oakland, California</h3>
                <p>
                    T2 Mechanical Room Oakland International Airport - Oakland, California
                    The $1.4 billion airport expansion project includes a new two-level terminal complex with 12 additional aircraft gates, a central food, beverage and retail shopping area,
                    rental car facilities, a 6,000 sq. ft. space multi-level parking garage and a two-level terminal access roadway system.  NBA designed the new central plant (T2 Mechanical Room).
                    The boilers in the mechanical room will serve the Terminal 12 with its expansion, modifications and extension.  The chillers are sized to serve half of the entire future
                    airport expansion.  The emergency generators will be sized to serve T2 expansion, extension and modifications and the new parking garage with its office.  The switchgears
                    will serve the equipment in this central plant as well as T2 expansion, modification and extension.  NBA was prime consultant for the new central utility plant
                    (T2 Mechanical Room), which will serve the current Terminal Two and future expansions.  NBA hired and managed the architect, structural and civil engineers, and
                    other sub consultants and designed the Mechanical and Electrical systems using high-energy efficient equipment.  Participated on green and sustainable design for this
                    new central utility plant that accommodates the future needs of the new expanded terminal and additional facilities. This project obtained LEED Silver Rating.
                    Oakland’s Terminal 2 recently became &quot;the first airport passenger terminal in the United States to be awarded Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver
                    Certification by the U.S. Green Building Council.&quot;  LEED Silver Certification of Oakland’s Terminal 2 extension and renovation was based on a number of green design and
                    construction features that positively impact the project itself and the broader community.  These features include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Energy efficiency measures that exceed California energy standards by 25% and reduce carbon emissions by an estimated 211 tons per year.</li>
                    <li>Diversion from landfills of more than 80% of jobsite waste, by recycling or reusing scrap drywall, metal, plywood, carpet, and other materials.</li>
                    <li>Water conservation measures yielding 24% less water use than in a similar conventional building.</li>
                    <li>Selections of paint, carpet, glue, cabinetry, and plywood products that emit few or no volatile organic compounds, or VOC’s – the stuff that gives paint that strong smell- and are therefore better for the environment and our traveling public than conventional products.</li>
                    <li>An advanced stormwater treatment system that channels runoff into plant-filled ditches, or swales, providing a natural filtering system that removes pollutants before the water reaches the San Francisco Bay.</li>
                    <li>Innovations such as a &quot;Green Housekeeping&quot; program to reduce environmental and health impacts of cleaning products and chemicals used in the terminals.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Construction Management Services for the Industrial Waste Water Treatment Plant at SFO–San Francisco, CA
                    The existing state-of-the-art Mel Leong Treatment Plant is a combined sanitary sewer and industrial waste water treatment plant.  
                    NBA Engineering is a Prime Joint Venture with PMA Consultants to provide bridging documents to be issued for the design build phase of the project.  
                    NBA’ task will be providing HVAC, Plumbing, Electrical Power & Emergency Power, Bridging Documents as well as Design Management.  We have brought 
                    on board CH2M Hill for the design of the treatment process of the project.  We provide a comprehensive project control and reporting system capable 
                    of complying with the reporting requirements mandated for federally-funded projects.
